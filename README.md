## Getting Started

To get started running this bot, you will need Python 3.5+. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Prerequisites

Firstly, you will need to install discord.py, which is the API wrapper for discord that this project utilizes

```
# Linux/OS X
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

### Installing

There are a few things you must do before you can run this bot in your server.
Firstly, create a project folder. You may name it anything you like.
Next, download [`setup.py`](https://github.com/bebe-morse/YashwanthBOT/blob/master/v1/setup.py) and run it in that folder.
You may now download [`source.py`](https://github.com/bebe-morse/YashwanthBOT/blob/master/v1/source.py) and configure it in [`settings.ini`](https://github.com/bebe-morse/YashwanthBOT/blob/master/v1/config.ini). Make sure to set the token to your discord bot otherwise it will not run! Make sure to download all the project files like `methods.py`
